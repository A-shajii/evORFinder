The dataset used to train the model contains genomic sequences from bacterial species within the human microbiome, as well as sequences curated from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) H37Rv for biological validation. Sequences were annotated as either coding (bona-fide smORFs) or non-coding. The data was preprocessed by removing incomplete sequences, filtering ambiguous nucleotides, and standardizing input lengths. A subset of 10,000 entries was used for training, validation, and testing.
